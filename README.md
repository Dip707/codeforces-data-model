[INCOMPLETE]

Hi, this is project I have created to illustrate how we can use TypeDB and TypeQL to make meaningful queries through codeforces data.

All the data used in this project was generated from the Codeforces public API and the dataloader.py was used to convert the data from the json format into TYPEQL queries.

The main.rs file contains the usage of the rust client for the TypeQL commands.
